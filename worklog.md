# Worklog — Dummy Surfers by FSK

Task ID: 1

Task: Build "Dummy Surfers by FSK" — a premium Subway-Surfers-style Android endless runner — in Kotlin + LibGDX per the user's 35-section spec. User explicitly required Kotlin/LibGDX stack, no APK delivery needed (they will push to GitHub themselves), GitHub Actions CI to build artifacts.

Work Log:
- Parsed full spec from /home/z/my-project/upload/Pasted Content_1788192189258.txt (Subway Surfers reference analysis, mandatory Kotlin+LibGDX stack, 35 feature sections).
- Installed toolchain in sandbox: Gradle 8.9 (/home/z/tools/gradle-8.9), Android SDK 34 (platform-tools, platforms;android-34, build-tools;34.0.0) at /home/z/android-sdk (user-space, no root). Java 21 preinstalled.
- Scaffolded multi-module Gradle (Kotlin DSL) project at /home/z/my-project/dummy-surfers: core / android / desktop.
- Wrote complete game (~4,000 lines Kotlin):
  - config/GameConfig.kt — all tunables (speeds, jump/slide, phases, economy)
  - state/ — GameState enums, MiniJson parser, SaveManager (Preferences+JSON, versioned deep-merge), MissionGenerator
  - utils/ — Mathz (easing, noise, speed curve), ObjectPool
  - gfx/TextureGen.kt — ALL art procedural via Pixmap: sky/fog/glows/clouds/2 skylines, 10-frame spinning coins, 5 power-up icons, 4 character portraits, 9-patch panels/buttons, launcher icons
  - audio/AudioManager.kt — pure PCM synth + AudioDevice mixer thread: 132BPM music sequencer (kick/hat/bass/lead, intensity follows speed) + 14 synthesized SFX
  - camera/Projection.kt — pseudo-3D scale(z)=f/(f+z), fog, camera follow, shake
  - input/SwipeDetector.kt — 15px dead zone / 300ms window / dominant axis + keyboard
  - entities/Entities.kt — Player (lane lerp, jump buffer, slide, squash, lean), Train, Obstacle, Coin, PowerUpPickup, Chaser, 4 CharacterDefs
  - world/WorldGenerator.kt — endless segments (open/urban/station/bridge/tunnel/industrial) + 16 deco kinds
  - systems/Spawner.kt — 9 pattern families with IRON RULES (≥1 safe lane, reaction gaps, same-action spacing, coin trails on safe path)
  - systems/Difficulty.kt — 5-phase curve base+(max−base)(1−e^(−d·k))
  - particles/Particles.kt — pooled sparkles/bursts/confetti/streaks/texts
  - rendering/ — WorldRenderer (7-layer parallax, rails/sleepers convergence, tunnel darkness), DecoRenderer (16 prop types with 3D box), EntityRenderer (z-sorted trains with liveries/windows/graffiti, obstacles, coins, power-ups, procedural runner animation, chaser)
  - ui/UiTheme.kt + UiController.kt — freetype Press Start 2P fonts, immediate-mode game UI: menu, HUD (score/multiplier/coins/power-up bars), pause, game over (count-up + confetti), shop (characters/upgrades/trails), missions, settings, tutorial overlay, toasts
  - DummySurfersGame.kt — orchestrator: state machine, collisions (AABB), near-miss, magnet flight, power-up timers, boost zoom+speed lines, chaser, tutorial flow, letterboxed 720×1280 stage
- Fixed first-pass compile errors (hex Int literals, kotlin.math.pow, AudioDevice.writeSamples API, PlayerState import package, NinePatch.setColor, val-reassign shadowing).
- BUILD RESULTS: :core:compileKotlin ✅, :android:assembleDebug ✅ (android-debug.apk 2.0 MB produced in-sandbox!), :desktop:compileKotlin ✅, Gradle wrapper 8.9 generated ✅.
- Added .github/workflows/android.yml (debug APK + release APK + release AAB on push) and README.md with full checklist + build/run instructions.
- Generated launcher icons procedurally (Python zlib PNG, mipmap-*.png ×4 densities).
- Updated Next.js landing page (src/app/page.tsx) as a project dashboard for the game.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable: complete, compiling Kotlin+LibGDX game at /home/z/my-project/dummy-surfers (APK verified buildable in-sandbox).
- User next step: push dummy-surfers/ to their GitHub → Actions builds debug APK + release AAB automatically. Optional: add signing config for Play.
- Web preview (/) shows the project dashboard only (sandbox cannot run Android GUI; the game itself runs on device via CI-built APK or desktop via `./gradlew desktop:run`).
- Known minor risks: audio device latency varies per device; shop scrolls are static-height (content fits 720×1280); tutorial swipe gating verified by code review only (no emulator in sandbox).

Task: Landing dashboard + verification + recurring QA loop

Work Log:
- Rewrote src/app/page.tsx as a sunset-themed project dashboard (animated hero skyline, build-status cards for core/android/desktop/CI, 8 feature cards, 4-step GitHub shipping guide, sticky footer).
- Updated layout.tsx metadata (title/description/keywords/authors → Dummy Surfers by FSK).
- Verified with agent-browser: desktop 1280x720 + mobile 390x844 render clean, scroll works, zero console/page errors, footer sticks via min-h-screen flex + mt-auto.
- Created recurring cron job 349373 "Dummy Surfers — 15min webDevReview" (every 15 min, Asia/Karachi) for ongoing QA/iteration.

Stage Summary:
- / route = project dashboard (verified). Kotlin game at dummy-surfers/ builds: core ✅ android-debug.apk ✅ desktop ✅. CI workflow + README ready for the user's GitHub push.

Task ID: 3 (cron review round 2)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator, 15-min webDevReview)
Task: QA + game juice improvements + dashboard v2

Work Log:
- QA: Gradle builds green (core+android+desktop re-verified after changes), dev.log clean, worklog reviewed.
- Game fixes (dummy-surfers):
  - G1 BUGFIX: rainbow trail was rendering static teal → now hue-cycles via new Mathz.hsv(); emit position tightened to feet.
  - G2 JUICE: speed lines now also trigger at >88% max speed (spec 2.2), boost draws screen-edge vignette blur (spec 9) — TextureGen.vignette finally used.
  - G3 BUGFIX: music hat/lead intensity was baked at buffer-creation → now scaled at schedule time so music follows speed live.
  - G4 BUGFIX: shop/characters/upgrades/trails/missions panels now offset content by scrollY with bounds-skipping + clamped drag (maxScroll per panel); CHARACTERS panel made scrollable.
  - G5 WORLD LIFE: new DecoKind.PASSENGER (commuters on platforms, 4 coat variants, spawned 2-4 per station); bird flock in WorldRenderer sky (5 birds, sine flapping wings, parallax drift).
- Builds: :android:assembleDebug → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (APK regenerated); :core + :desktop → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Dashboard v2 (src/app/page.tsx): sticky anchor nav; stats strip (35/35, ~4,000 LOC, 2.0 MB APK, 100% procedural); interactive 35-tile spec-coverage grid with hover labels; styled build-console terminal card; changelog section (v1.1 entries); card hover-lift polish; spinning coin in runner strip; version bumped to v1.1.0.
- Verification: agent-browser daemon went unresponsive (CDP channel closed) mid-QA → switched to direct Playwright 1.62.1 script: desktop+mobile screenshots captured, all 6 sections present, spec tile hover works ("§9 — Power-ups ✓ implemented"), ZERO console/page errors. QA script removed after use.

Stage Summary:
- Game: 3 bugs fixed (rainbow trail, audio intensity, shop scroll), 2 juice features added (top-speed streaks+vignette, birds+passengers). All Gradle modules green.
- Dashboard: v2 shipped and browser-verified with zero errors.
- Next round suggestions: gameplay tuning session (coin magnet feel, difficulty wall at ~2500m), add tunnel ambience sound layer, billboard brand text via font renderer, optional: seedable daily-run mode; keep an eye on agent-browser daemon health (Playwright fallback proven).
